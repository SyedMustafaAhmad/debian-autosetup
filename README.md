# linux-autosetup
A script that sets up all of the configurations, dependecies, tools and softwares I need on any system

Uptill now, I've added software, tool installs and source download implementation for:
  - Debian-based Systems
  - Arch-based Systems
  
To Do:
  - Still need to add implementation of placing config files at proper places and setting up /usr/bin/ directories
  - Need to add implementation to make softwares like sxiv and st default

Fixes:
  - (not done) In dependencies, add git and X11 libraries
